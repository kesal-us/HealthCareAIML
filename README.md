## Problem Statement

The proposed project is an **AI-based medical diagnosis system** that predicts multiple diseases using machine learning models. The web application enables users to upload medical data, which is analyzed by pre-trained ML models to detect health conditions.

### **Why This Project?**

- **Reduces diagnostic errors**: ML models offer high accuracy in medical predictions.
- **Saves time for doctors and patients**: Automates the initial diagnosis process.
- **Bridges the gap between technology and healthcare**: Patients can get quick medical insights.
- **Available to remote users**: Patients in rural or underserved areas can benefit.
